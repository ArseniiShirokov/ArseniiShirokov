## About me
I am a student of the Yandex School of Data Analysis and "Computer vision, graphics and image processing" master program of the [Graphics and Media Lab](https://graphics.cs.msu.ru/home.html). 

Now I am actively engaged in research in the field of deep learning.

This repository serves more as a repository for educational projects, but also for some of my pet or open source projects.
